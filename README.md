#### Brief Description of Project - The main objective of the Solar Power Management System is to automate the existing manual system using a web-based application, meeting their needs so that their valuable data/information can be stored for an extended period with easy access and manipulation. The necessary software and hardware are easily accessible and simple to use.
The Solar Power Management System described above can result in an error-free, secure, dependable, and quick management system. It can help the user focus on their other activities rather than record keeping. As a result, it will assist organizations in making better use of their resources. Businesses can keep computerized duplication.
In other words, to succeed in knowledge, one does not need to be distracted by irrelevant information.
The project's goal is to make the system more reliable, easier to use, faster, and more informative. Essentially, the project describes how to manage continuous performance and provide better services to the client.
